# OASIS üåç üõ∞Ô∏è
**O**rbital **A**nalytics and **S**pace **I**nformation **S**ystem

## üöÄ Project Overview
OASIS is a predictive analytics platform for assessing and forecasting near-Earth space environments. Utilizing data from NASA, NOAA, and space-track.org, it provides critical insights for satellite operations, space missions, and space environment forecasting.

The backend component of the system is responsible for ingesting, processing, and storing data, while the frontend is a Next.js-based interface for displaying results.

## ‚ú® Key Features
### 1. Data Sources
- Ingests data from multiple public APIs, including NASA DONKI (CME, Geostorm, Solar Flare, HSS), NASA Exoplanet Archive, Near Earth Object Web Service, and space-track.org (SatCat, GP).
- Data is sanitized and stored in a PostgreSQL database.

### 2. Frontend User Interface
- Built using Next.js, React, and TypeScript, providing users with an intuitive way to visualize and interact with the data.
- Utilizes Tailwind CSS for responsive and modern UI components.
- Includes various modules for different aspects of space data visualization and analysis:
  - Dashboard
  - Data Display
  - Near Earth Objects
  - Orbital Regions
  - Space Weather
  - Risk Assessment
  - Satellite Status
  - Debris Tracking
  - Exoplanets

### 3. Backend Services
- Implements RESTful APIs using Next.js API routes to fetch data from the PostgreSQL database.
- Handles data ingestion, processing, and storage using Python scripts.
- Utilizes asyncio and aiohttp for asynchronous data fetching and processing.
- Includes a Lambda function (`lambda_function.py`) for automated data ingestion and updates.

### 4. Database
- Uses PostgreSQL for data storage.
- Includes tables for various data types: NEO, CME, Geostorm, Solar Flare, HSS, Exoplanets, Satellite Catalog, and GP data.
- Utilizes asyncpg for asynchronous database operations.

### 5. Machine Learning
- Includes a Python script (`predictor.py`) for machine learning-based predictive analytics.
- Trains models using historical data to predict environmental risks in different orbital regions.
- Stores prediction results back into the database for visualization in the frontend.

npm install
npm run dev
```

4. Set up a Python virtual environment and install dependencies for the backend scripts:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the data ingestion script:
```bash
python lambda_function.py
```
6. Run the ML predictor script:
```bash
python predictor.py
```
7. Access the application at http://localhost:3000.
