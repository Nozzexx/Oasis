# OASIS üåç üõ∞Ô∏è

**O**rbital **A**nalysis and **S**pace **I**nformation **S**ystem

## üöÄ Project Overview

OASIS is a comprehensive application that combines near-Earth space environment assessment with exoplanet habitability prediction. This tool aims to provide valuable insights for space operations, satellite management, and exoplanet research using data from various open-source datasets including NASA, NOAA, and space-track.org.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. Data Ingestion and Processing
- Import data from multiple sources:
  - NASA's Exoplanet Archive API
  - NASA's space environment datasets
  - NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center
  - Space-track.org orbital debris data
- Clean, normalize, and combine data from various sources using AWS Lambda functions
- Handle missing values and outliers

### 2. Near-Earth Space Environment Analysis
- Space environment rating model considering:
  - Space weather conditions
  - Orbital debris density and distribution
  - Radiation levels
  - Atmospheric drag for different orbital altitudes
- Predict space environment conditions using machine learning models
- Historical view of data over time

### 3. User Interface
- React-based GUI for intuitive interaction with the application
- Dashboard for overview of key space environment and exoplanet data
- Detailed views for in-depth analysis of specific datasets

## üì• Installation and Usage

As OASIS is currently deployed on AWS, there's no local installation process. However, for development purposes:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-organization/OASIS.git
   cd OASIS
   ```

2. Set up AWS CLI and configure your credentials.

3. Deploy the backend services to AWS:
   (Include specific deployment instructions here)

4. For the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
