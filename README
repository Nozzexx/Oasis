OASIS

OASIS is an open-source application built to allow users to easily review data taken from the NASA Exoplanet API. 
OASIS utilizes an algorithm to provide a Habitability Score for each exoplanet based on available data.
OASIS also allows the user to preview a 3D model of each exoplanet including size, scale orbit, rotation and more.
