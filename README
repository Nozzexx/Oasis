OASIS (Orbital Analysis and Space Information System)
Project Overview
OASIS is a comprehensive Java-based application that combines near-Earth space environment assessment with exoplanet habitability prediction. This tool aims to provide valuable insights for space operations, satellite management, and exoplanet research using data from various open-source datasets including NASA, NOAA, and space-track.org.
Note: This README outlines the full scope of possibilities for OASIS. The actual implemented features may vary based on development priorities and resources.
Key Features
1. Data Ingestion and Processing

-Import data from multiple sources:

--NASA's Exoplanet Archive API
--NASA's space environment datasets
--NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center
--Space-track.org orbital debris data

-Clean, normalize, and combine data from various sources
-Handle missing values and outliers

2. Near-Earth Space Environment Analysis

-Space environment rating model considering:

--Space weather conditions
--Orbital debris density and distribution
--Radiation levels
--Atmospheric drag for different orbital altitudes

-Predict space environment conditions

3. Exoplanet Habitability Analysis

-Habitability scoring model considering:

--Planet size and mass
--Orbital characteristics
--Star type and characteristics
--Presence of atmosphere (if detectable)

-Predict potential habitability of exoplanets

4. Data Visualization

-Interactive visualizations of near-Earth space environments
-Rating heatmap for different orbital regions
-Visualizations of exoplanet systems
-Habitability heatmap of known exoplanets
-Comparative charts of exoplanet characteristics

5. User Interface

-JavaFX-based GUI for intuitive interaction with the application
-Dashboard for overview of key space environment and exoplanet data
-Detailed views for in-depth analysis of specific datasets

Potential Extensions

-Predict characteristics of undiscovered exoplanets
-Simulate exoplanet atmospheric conditions
-Optimize satellite constellation configurations
-Create a risk assessment module for space missions or satellite hardware
