# OASIS üåç üõ∞Ô∏è

**O**rbital **A**nalysis and **S**pace **I**nformation **S**ystem

## üöÄ Project Overview

OASIS is a comprehensive Java-based application that combines near-Earth space environment assessment with exoplanet habitability prediction. This tool aims to provide valuable insights for space operations, satellite management, and exoplanet research using data from various open-source datasets including NASA, NOAA, and space-track.org.

> **Note:** This README outlines the full scope of possibilities for OASIS. The actual implemented features may vary based on development priorities and resources.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. Data Ingestion and Processing
- Import data from multiple sources:
  - NASA's Exoplanet Archive API
  - NASA's space environment datasets
  - NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center
  - Space-track.org orbital debris data
- Clean, normalize, and combine data from various sources
- Handle missing values and outliers

### 2. Near-Earth Space Environment Analysis
- Space environment rating model considering:
  - Space weather conditions
  - Orbital debris density and distribution
  - Radiation levels
  - Atmospheric drag for different orbital altitudes
- Predict space environment conditions

### 3. Exoplanet Habitability Analysis
- Habitability scoring model considering:
  - Planet size and mass
  - Orbital characteristics
  - Star type and characteristics
  - Presence of atmosphere (if detectable)
- Predict potential habitability of exoplanets

### 4. Data Visualization
- Interactive visualizations of near-Earth space environments
- Rating heatmap for different orbital regions
- Visualizations of exoplanet systems
- Habitability heatmap of known exoplanets
- Comparative charts of exoplanet characteristics

### 5. User Interface
- JavaFX-based GUI for intuitive interaction with the application
- Dashboard for overview of key space environment and exoplanet data
- Detailed views for in-depth analysis of specific datasets

## üöÄ Potential Extensions

- Predict characteristics of undiscovered exoplanets
- Simulate exoplanet atmospheric conditions
- Optimize satellite constellation configurations
- Create a risk assessment module for space missions or satellite hardware

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- Java 17+
- JavaFX 17+
- Maven
- JSON processing libraries (e.g., Jackson)
- Charting libraries (e.g., JFreeChart or JavaFX built-in charts)
